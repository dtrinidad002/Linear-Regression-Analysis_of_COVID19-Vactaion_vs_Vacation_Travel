# COVID_19-Vactaion_Vs_Vacation-Travel
### Final project for the MIDS-W203 "Statistics for Data Science" course (Summer 2021)

## Project scope: 
The agency head of toursim hired my team to perform a linear regression study on vacations taken during the summer of 2021. 
It would be impossible to understand travel this summer without also talking about the impacts of covid-19. Travel this summer likely to be quite different from travel last summer; even travel within this summer might have substantial variations from month to month due to changes in policies that affect personal interactions


## Research Question: 
 Is there a statistically significant relationship between COVID-19 (fully vaccinated population, testing positive, related deaths & testing ) towards community mobility related to travel in California?
